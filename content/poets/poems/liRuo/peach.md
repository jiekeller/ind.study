# Peach
**By Li Ruo**

In August<br />
the peach has ripened<br />
Fallen from the tree<br />
onto the ground<br />
The chickens on the plantation<br />
quickly run towards the peach<br />
as if competing with us<br />
The chickens have eaten many peaches<br />
The delicate eggs<br />
are also delicious<br />
Full of flavor<br />
The chicken meat is also delicious<br />
Soft and tender<br />
Stewed chicken soup<br />
Fragrant and tasty<br />
Next time<br />
I want to go to Taoyuan<br />
and eat peaches<br />

Like some of Li Ruo’s other poems, this poem, short and straightforward, focuses on the everyday, summer life in the countryside. Describing what she sees around her, Li Ruo paints a picture of the ripened peaches falling to the ground and chickens hurriedly running to eat them. From the sweet peaches, the eggs and meat from the chickens are just as delicious. This poem may reveal Li Ruo’s reflection on her rural lifestyle, grounding herself in the memories of home while she works miles away in the city.

                    As China has moved into the twenty-first century with rapid industrialization and economic development, migrant laborers have been caught in this development at the bottom of the social ladder. They face hellish working conditions, isolating living arrangements, and a lack of social recognition. To combat these hardships, some migrant workers have turned to poetry as an outlet to voice their plight. On this website, I have translated and examined the poems of several contemporary Chinese migrant workers. As these workers write for their voices to be heard, I have translated these poems for the general Western audience, to increase the readership and accessibility of this literature. The poems I have selected contain a wide variety of themes, from collective spirit and togetherness, to death and feelings of isolation. The hardships endured by Chinese workers and the adversity they face is life-or-death, as they fight for their lives, and that severity is reflected in many poems in this collection. At times, their writing contains aggressive and violent language, rich with cultural and historical references. At the same time, these untrained poets depict vibrant and animated imagery, writing elegiac lines of poetry. I have translated a total of forty four poems in this collection, and provide close readings of every poem to assist the reader in understanding this complex poetry. As these migrant workers give voice to the human rights issues they face, I find it important to translate their works and amplify their voice to as wide of an audience as possible.

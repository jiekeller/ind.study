                As China has moved into the twenty-first century with rapid industrialization and economic development, migrant laborers have been caught in this development at the bottom of the social ladder. 
                They face hellish working conditions, isolating living arrangements, and a lack of social recognition. 
                To combat these hardships, some migrant workers have turned to poetry as an outlet to voice their plight and aspirations. 
                On this website, I have translated and examined the poems of several contemporary Chinese migrant workers. 
                As these workers write for their voices to be heard, I have translated these poems for the general English speaking audience, to increase the readership and accessibility of this literature. 
                The poems I have selected contain a wide variety of themes, from collective spirit and togetherness, to death and feelings of isolation. The hardships endured by Chinese workers and the adversity they face life-or-death, as they fight for their lives, and that severity is reflected in many poems in this collection. 
                At times, their writing contains aggressive and violent language, rich with cultural and historical references. At the same time, these worker poets depict vibrant and animated imagery, writing elegiac lines of poetry.

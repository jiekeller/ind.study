<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>At night coming home from my shift <br />
I, alone <br />
in the dormitory, eat Zongzi <br />
Only paying attention to my stomach and appetite <br />
unconsciously chewing <br />
The Dragon Boat Festival benefits gifted by the factory <br />
 <br />
I don’t know what triggered these thoughts <br />
Suddenly I realize <br />
I’m thinking of Jiangnan <br />
Recalling I once crossed Suzhou’s bridge <br />
Recalling Xiangjiang’s water in the book <br />
I’m not certain if I thought of <br />
a person called Qu Yuan <br />
Suddenly the glutinous rice wrapped in leaves <br />
like a spur <br />
is stuck in my throat <br />
 <br />

A short poem by Xiao Hai, “A Night at the Jiaxing Factory Eating Zongzi” follows the subjects wandering mind after his presumably long shift during the day. Isolated and alone, the worker eats zongzi, sticky rice dumplings, as the following lines describe the thoughts his tired mind goes through. Xiao Hai depicts a separation of body from mind in the subject and the worker is transported back to Jiangnan, presumably his hometown. While the subject recounts places he has passed by (perhaps) on his journey to the factory, Xiao Hai hazily recalls a person called 屈原 Qu Yuan. This Qu Yuan is likely the Chinese poet from the Warring States period, who took his own life by throwing himself into the Miluo river. Just as the subject recalls Qu Yuan, he is suddenly pulled back to reality, with some of the zongzi stuck in his throat. This sickening thought of suicide is chilling to his own body, and he struggles to swallow rice as he is filled with emotion</p>

            At night coming home from my shift <br />
            I, alone <br />
            in the dormitory, eat Zongzi <br />
            Only paying attention to my stomach and appetite <br />
            unconsciously chewing <br />
            The Dragon Boat Festival benefits gifted by the factory <br />
            <br />
            I don’t know what triggered these thoughts <br />
            Suddenly I realize <br />
            I’m thinking of Jiangnan <br />
            Recalling I once crossed Suzhou’s bridge <br />
            Recalling Xiangjiang’s water in the book <br />
            I’m not certain if I thought of <br />
            a person called Qu Yuan <br />
            Suddenly the glutinous rice wrapped in leaves <br />
            like a spur <br />
            is stuck in my throat <br />

            “A Night at the Jiaxing Factory Eating Zongzi” follows the subject’s wandering mind after his presumably long shift during the day. Isolated and alone, the worker eats zongzi, sticky rice dumplings, and the following lines describe the thoughts his tired mind goes through. Xiao Hai depicts a separation of body from mind in the subject: the worker is transported back to Jiangnan, presumably his hometown. While the subject recounts places he has passed by (perhaps) on his journey to the factory, Xiao Hai hazily recalls a person called 屈原 Qu Yuan. Qu Yuan is a Chinese poet from the Warring States period, who took his own life by throwing himself into the Miluo river. While the motivation for this reference is unclear, these thoughts evoke a confused and chilling feeling in Xiao Hai. Thrust back into reality, the poem ends as he notices some Zongzi stuck in his throat.

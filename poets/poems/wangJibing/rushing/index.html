            Many times<br />
            Life’s progress can be flat like a wood plank<br />
            A rider is a sharp nail<br />
            Only with a straight back<br />
            Can they turn life’s corners<br />
            Bent ones will fail <br />
            And be discarded<br />
            Or endure a fierce beating<br />
            Until it is straight again<br />

            This short poem by Wang Jibing represents the feelings of stagnation and lack of social mobility laborers experience in life. Wang compares his body to a nail, a common theme of migrant worker poetry. In this metaphor, Wang believes only the sharp, straight nails, or conforming workers can “turn the corners of life” and succeed. Meanwhile, the bent nails, the workers who don’t fully submit to society or are physically lacking, either disappear and cannot succeed or are forcefully beaten into shape, finally complying with society. 
                <div class="quotedpoetry"> 
                Bent ones will fail <br />
                And be discarded<br />
                Or endure a fierce beating<br />
                Until it is straight again<br />
                </div>
            The comparison speaks to the sacrifices made by laborers to succeed in society. Wang Jibing believes unless they stand with a straight back, presumably fitting into the rigid rules of society, workers will be disposed of or broken down into cogs, suitable to provide for the system.

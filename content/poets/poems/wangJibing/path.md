# Path
**By Wang Jibing**

A mountain range<br />
that rugged path would seem difficult to traverse<br />
but you can always get over mountains and hills<br />
A body of water<br />
would seem flat and plain<br />
yet is very hard to pass<br />

This short poem displays Wang Jibingâ€™s reflections on life and some guiding principles that extend beyond his individual career path. In describing a mountain range and a body of water, Wang Jibing illustrates that while some things look difficult on the surface, they can be manageable. On the other side, obstacles that look simple or flat, may in reality be unfeasible or much more challenging to pass. Put simply, things that look simple are often not, while things that look difficult can be more straightforward in the end.

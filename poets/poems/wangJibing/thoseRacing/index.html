<p><strong>By Wang Jibing</strong></p>

<p>Air becomes wind<br />
Wind becomes a blade<br />
Bone becomes a fire<br />
Fire becomes water<br />
Those racing against time do not have the four seasons<br />
They only have one stop and the next<br />
The world is a place name<br />
Wang Zhuang village is as well<br />
Everyday I can run into<br />
many racing delivery men<br />
Using both feet to hammer the ground<br />
In this human world, endlessly tempering the earth <br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>This short poem by Wang Ji-Bing exemplifies the endless cycle of work many <em>waimai xiaoge</em> (takeout boys) like Wang endure. In the beginning of the poem, lines such as “wind becomes a blade” illustrate the speed required of these drivers as Wang Ji-Bing rushes about getting to his next order. There is no time for rest, and no freedom to enjoy something as trivial as the four seasons. Wang Ji-Bing concludes the poem with the vivid imagery of many drivers hurrying about, their footsteps “hammering the ground… endlessly tempering the earth.” In these last lines, Wang poetically describes the relentless and thankless work of him and his colleagues.</p>

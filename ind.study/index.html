                <p> As China has moved into the twenty-first century with rapid industrialization and economic development, migrant laborers have been caught in this development at the bottom of the social ladder. They face hellish working conditions, isolating living arrangements, and a lack of social recognition. To combat these hardships, some migrant workers have turned to poetry as an outlet to voice their plight. In this paper, I examine and translate the poems of several contemporary Chinese migrant workers. As these workers write for their voices to be heard, I have translated these poems for the general Western audience, to increase the readership and accessibility of this literature. The poems I have selected contain militaristic language which is expressed in beautiful poetic imagery. The hardships endured by Chinese workers and the adversity they face is battle-like, as they fight for their lives. Their writing contains aggressive and violent wording, and is rich with cultural and historical references. At the same time, these untrained poets depict vibrant and animated imagery, writing elegiac lines of poetry. I worked to translate the beauty and “battler” language. As these migrant workers give voice to the human rights issues they face, I find it important to translate their works and amplify their voice to as wide of an audience as possible.

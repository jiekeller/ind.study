            She said, if you don’t *dagong*, how can you wear gold earrings?<br />
            She said, you’d better *dagong*, then everyday you can eat well<br />
            <br />
            While many people say they don’t want *dagong*<br />
            they still run off to the city <br />
            <br />
            With *dagong*, some people become bosses<br />
            With *dagong* some people build their homes<br />
            With *dagong*, some people live in the city and settle down<br />
            with *dagong*, some people pay for their siblings’ tuition……<br />
            At least, they wash away their earthy smell<br />
            and put on clean clothes<br />
            <br />
            You should admit, *dagong* for one year is better than working in the field for years<br />
            It really is better to *dagong* than to not<br />

            This more straightforward poem by Wu Xia encapsulates the casual conversation for many migrant workers on leaving their families to find *dagong* in the city. *Dagong*’s meaning loosely translates to doing manual work, or laboring work. In this translation, the pinyin transliteration for this word speaks more meaning in fewer words, directing my translation strategy. The strong class connotation of Wu Xia’s writing can be felt in lines like “At least, they wash away their earthy smell,” which speaks to the stigma between urban and rural living styles.

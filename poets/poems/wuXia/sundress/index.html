            The packaging shop is brightly lit<br />
            My hand holds an electric iron<br />
            Gathering all the heat in my hand<br />
            First, I want to smooth out the dress<br />
            So when it hangs on your shoulders it won’t hurt you<br />
            Then from the waistline start to smooth it out<br />
            Such a cute waistline<br />
            You can place a clear and fair hand there<br />
            In the tree-lined road<br />
            Caressing a quiet love<br />
            Finally spreading out the skirt<br />
            I want to smooth out each crease to be the same width<br />
            By the lake or the lawn, letting you<br />
            Wait for the wind to blow<br />
            So you can run, yet<br />
            You must let the skirt flutter about, maintaining it’s curvature<br />
            Just like a flower<br />
            <br />
            And I want to get off work<br />
            I want to wash off my sweaty factory clothes<br />
            I’ve already folded it up and packed it <br />
            The sundress, it will be transported out of the shop<br />
            Towards some market, some fashion shop<br />
            In some afternoon or night<br />
            Waiting only for you<br />
            <br />
            Foreign girl<br />
            I love you<br />

            This poem reads almost like a letter, as Wu Xia affectionately writes to the eventual consumer of the sundress she has made. Wu Xia assures the consumer of the dress’ careful stitching, envisioning the freedom and play that the dress allows. With this kind of language, Wu seems to be living through this foreign, unknown girl. While she spends great care and effort to create such a beautiful dress, she herself cannot wear it, and cannot enjoy it. This poem represents the aspirations of beauty and love that Wu Xia projects onto both this sundress, and the girl she imagines who will own it.

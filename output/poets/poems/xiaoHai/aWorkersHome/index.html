<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>A worker’s home is an iron framed bed<br />
So many workers, squeeze into a communal dorm<br />
I’m afraid the property developer might starve<br />
A worker’s home isn’t stable<br />
We don’t need a moving company when relocating<br />
Bearing the luggage and carrying the blankets<br />
They say that’s what wandering the world is<br />
A single worker’s home is silent<br />
Only wind blows outside, scraping the window glass<br />
A worker’s home has everything, a towel, a toothbrush, a heater waiting to be fixed<br />
It has pots of boiling blood and pots of helplessness<br />
quickly scooped up by the mistress, spoonful by spoonful<br /></p>

<p>A worker’s home is built through numbness and loneliness along the road to survival<br />
A worker’s home is on the ticket stub to their beloved hometown<br />
sprinkled with the sadness and delusion of honor and glory<br />
A worker’s home is on the overtime train but still ignored by society<br />
A worker’s home is the after-effect of forgotten love<br />
all the doctors in the city have closed their doors<br />
That unseen pain faintly lingers<br /></p>

<p>A worker still has a home<br />
and a home in the bottom of their heart<br />
where loved ones are waiting<br />
where passionate tears are waiting<br />
and a sincere heart purposefully hidden <br />
A worker still has a bed, and another bed,<br />
being the hotbed of the workshop<br />
Day and night, it bakes our lively body<br />
so exhausted, yet we cannot close our eyes<br />
Endless orders are like the fields of wheat we sow in blazing heat<br />
But ma’am, the motor is hot<br />
do I add oil or water?<br />
the motor is hot, do I add oil or water?<br />
<br />

In this poem, Xiao Hai explores the confusing delineation between work and home for migrant laborers in China. By defining the many temporary items and places that make up a worker’s home, Xiao Hai calls attention to the constant, daily and even hourly struggle workers like him face. By the end of the poem, the subject is so lost in the labor that consumes his life, he can no longer determine how to operate the machinery at his job. Xiao Hai writes,
<br />
<br />
But ma’am, the motor is hot<br />
Do I add oil or water?<br />
The motor is hot, do I add oil or water?<br />
<br />
These lines illustrate the mind numbing pattern of a worker’s life, as the subject cannot identify if oil goes in the machine or if he should add water like he’s cooking or boiling a pot. With this conclusion Xiao Hai questions: how can a worker have something they call a home if there is nothing that differentiates it from their workplace?</p>

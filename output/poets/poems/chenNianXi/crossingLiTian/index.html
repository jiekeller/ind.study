<p><strong>By Chen Nianxi</strong></p>

<p>It has already been close to 3 years since I left here<br />
Today I suddenly remembered<br />
Only two tall ginkgo trees remain<br />
People who return here again<br />
have already spent the remaining years of their lives elsewhere <br /></p>

<p>There is traffic at the bus stop <br />
But there isn’t a bus that can take me to my battlefield <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
The things we want to look for <br />
are dispersed one by one by the autumn wind<br />
Even the General’s headquarters and tracks <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><br />
have only left doubts and loneliness<br /></p>

<p>The bus leading to Dongzhimen<br />
also leads to a torrential rain<br />
The person facing the window<br />
The glass reflects his gray hair and he realizes<br />
No matter where the bus leads<br />
he’s really going to his tomb <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><br /></p>

<p>Poplar flowers are snowy, poplar leaves green<br />
Women under the shade face passerbyers<br />
selling a Shandong apple <br />
The youth on the yellow cart rides with happiness on two wind wheels <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup><br />
Half the car section holds apples<br />
the other half, a script of their lives, impossible to be written<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>In this poem, Chen Nianxi uses many historical military references to demonstrate the battle-like, life and death circumstances for migrant workers. As the poet waits for a bus to take him to his factory, he questions his life, job and social mobility. Chen Nian-Xi writes,</p>

<p>There is traffic at the bus stop <br />
But there isn’t a bus that can take me to my battlefield <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><br />
The things we want to look for <br />
are dispersed one by one by the autumn wind<br />
Even the General’s headquarters and tracks <sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><br />
have only left doubts and loneliness<br /></p>

<p>The bus leading to Dongzhimen<br />
also leads to a torrential rain<br />
The person facing the window<br />
The glass reflects his gray hair and he realizes<br />
No matter where the bus leads<br />
he’s really going to his tomb <br /></p>

<p>In the first stanza above, Chen Nian-Xi uses the analogy of a battlefield in comparison to the factory or manual work he will soon go to, defining the stakes of his workplace and his labor as life or death just like in battle. Chen Nian-Xi additionally references General Fu, a 20th century KMT general, employing this historical reference to show the loneliness and uncertainty of migrant worker life in the next line. In this second stanza, the lines depicting a man on the bus demonstrate Chen Nianxi’s belief that not only do migrant workers lose their youth in labor, but also their lives as they are really “going to [their] tomb” each time they get on a factory bus.</p>

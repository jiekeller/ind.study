            When love leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Let us sing a joyful song<br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            this spring is splendid and brilliant<br />
            <br />
            When youth leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Let us put down that liquor and smoke <br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            life still has many roads yet to be traveled<br />
            <br />
            When dreams leave us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Even if discouraged, live on<br />
            Either run away, or lift my head up to keep going<br />
            Searching the earth for new roads and laughter <br />
            <br />
            When choices leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Caught in the flow of time<br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            you can still find company in misery<br />
            <br />
            Ah—<br />
            <br />
            When love leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Let us sing the song Lucky as Shit<br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            996 requires a grateful heart<br />
            <br />
            When communication leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Let us explode or die in silence?<br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            we still want to communicate<br />
            <br />
            When dreams leave us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            Even if discouraged, live on<br />
            Either run away, or lift my head up to keep going<br />
            Searching the earth for new roads and laughter<br />
            <br />
            When choices leaves us behind<br />
            what am I supposed to do?<br />
            With the ups and downs of this destined era<br />
            Although society is cold and unjust<br />
            you can still find company in misery<br />
            <br />
            To meet others with this shared fate<br />
            Let us sing this song together!<br />

            In this poem, Xu Duo articulates the collective strength in unity of migrant workers, reciting a rhythmic, song-like pattern. When something so natural and fundamental, such as love, youth or choice leaves him and his fellow workers behind, he ruminates on what to do next. Xu Duo is well aware of the challenges and barriers keeping him down in this world (such as the demanding '996' work schedule), yet he maintains an unwavering positivity, relying on his compatriots to derive strength and union. As he recites at the end of the poem, “Although society is cold and unjust [y]ou can still find company in misery [t]o meet others with this shared fate [l]et us sing this song together!”

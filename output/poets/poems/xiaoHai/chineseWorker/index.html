      <h1 id="chinese-worker">Chinese Worker</h1>
<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>I am a Chinese worker<br />
Every corner of the world has our revolutionary companions<br />
Maybe it’s intentional or maybe it’s unintentional<br />
But we all stand here, true and real<br />
Using our two laboring hands to face the storm engulfing the globe<br />
<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
In this large, steel, concrete building, they rear our cheap youth like cattle<br />
The changes of the seasons don’t belong to us<br />
the food and vegetables are not concerned with us <br />
All we can do is export the mysterious barcode Made in China, a flowing frenzy reaching <br />
every street and neighborhood of the four oceans and seven continents <br />
Using the spoils of war obtained in the October Revolution in exchange for tickets to home at the end of the year<br />
<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
The mundane points of the day in time’s gears make me boil and explode<br />
That shipping container crossing the sea carries all of our transient, futile pursuits<br />
Years of stars and sparks whizz by<br />
The heavy rain enters my chest, the strong wind blows endlessly <br /></p>

<p>In the lightning and thunder I ask myself<br />
When do we give ourselves the time to follow a wild pursuit of life<br />
8,000 li too far<br />
3,000 li too close<br />
We, in this vast land of 9,600,00 square kilometer <br />
Surviving through the night<br />
I came from the village<br />
You came from the town<br />
We toil together, barefoot, in this dazzling, dreamlike, solid metropolis.<br />
<br />
Facing the gunshot of the second Industrial Revolution<br />
I want to write a letter to the blonde, blue-eyed yuppie on the opposite shore of the ocean<br />
A non-deliverable letter <br />
Tell them how gorgeous spring flowers are <br />
Tell them how high the birds fly in the sky<br />
Tell them the people walking on that ground<br />
Look so well-dressed<br />
Ah, they makes us feel ashamed of ourselves<br />
On the workshop’s hotbed we shamefully fall asleep in a flash <br />
Not knowing how, we woke up unexpectedly from this dream without a sign<br />
We don’t understand at all<br />
The unbearable pain<br />
I more so want to ask them<br />
Why do clouds cover the sun at dawn<br />
Why, after rain, does the sky not have a rainbow<br />
Why do the city night lights resemble the daytime<br />
Why the once vast and mighty river is now full of sparkling neon lights or a barren wasteland, covered in weeds<br />
It is overgrown with ramparts like the Great Wall’s Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers as far as the eye can see<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers holding bronze in their hands<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers smoking cigarettes<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers equipped with clanging armor plating<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers, silent as the dead <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
<br /></p>

      <p>This line literally translates to “Chinese workers as silent as a mystery.” However, this phrase does not have the same metaphorical weight in English, so I translated this as “Chinese workers, silent as the dead.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><strong>By Li Ruo</strong></p>

<p>I am a floating duckweed<br />
Floating along without direction<br />
Because you can’t take root<br />
a gust of wind will blow you away without a trace<br /></p>

<p>I am a floating duckweed<br />
Going forward alone without lonely sorrow<br />
During the day I am accompanied by the clouds reflected in the water<br />
At night the stars and moon see my yearning<br />
When we come together<br />
it is also a beautiful sight <br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>This poem gives strong insight to both the translocality of migrant workers and the solidarity Li Ruo finds along her isolating journey.  Firstly, Li Ruo views herself as a floating duckweed that clearly symbolizes her wandering feelings and lack of a consistent “home.” As a duckweed cannot grow roots and will be blown away by the slightest gust of wind, migrant workers cannot settle down in any particular city and must move to the next work opportunity as soon as it arises. Secondly, while without companions, Li Ruo fights the isolation of traveling labor by finding solace in her surroundings. This can be seen in the second stanza, as Li Ruo writes,</p>

<p>I am a floating duckweed<br />
Going forward alone without lonely sorrow<br />
During the day I am accompanied by the clouds reflected in the water<br />
At night the stars and moon see my yearning<br />
When we come together<br />
it is also a beautiful sight <br /></p>

<p>These lines directly speak to the courageous solidarity migrant workers can achieve, while battling loneliness and alienation. Not only can Li Ruo find companionship in nature , but in the last lines she also holds conviction in the collective strength of migrant workers.</p>

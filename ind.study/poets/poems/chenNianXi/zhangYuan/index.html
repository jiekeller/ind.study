<p><strong>By Chen Nianxi</strong></p>

<p>I was in a large manufacturing building when I saw him<br />
He had just smeared oil paint on the wooden furniture<br />
This day he he just happened to be fifty five<br />
The oil he brushed deceived me<br /></p>

<p>When he raised his head, I was still looking at him<br />
another world in his eyes<br />
A world many of us have all had<br />
All of the earth’s geography is mostly the same<br />
but too secretive to describe<br /></p>

<p>The temporary rest room set up multiple books<br />
One book among them is already poor and shabby<br />
It is a poetry anthology, as for the title of the book I will hide it here<br />
At the same time I will hide the first half of Lao Zhang’s life<br />
Their experience is definitely not as interesting as yours<br /></p>

<p>Lao Zhang had significance once<br />
It was painting beautiful bedside scenery into a pipa<br />
So that it’s master heard lonely goose sounds every night<br />
The Han Autumn Moon song blurs the whole house<br />
Those thirteen early years grew into the Emperor<br /></p>

<p>I powerlessly watch after fifty five years of Zhang Yuanlun’s life<br />
And powerlessly watch my own years<br />
Don’t pass his afternoon, in my lonesome I arrived at this warm elm riverbank<br />
Magnificent, torrential water moved swift while the shore slow<br />
Like a scrubbing brush, the setting sun wipes away another day in this world<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>While it is difficult to decipher this melancholy poem by Chen Nianxi, there are clear feelings of loneliness and sadness throughout. The poem first follows the poet looking at Zhang Yuanlun,  a fellow migrant worker. The most interesting and understandable lines of this poem appear in the fourth stanza, as Chen Nianxi writes:</p>

<p>It was painting beautiful bedside scenery into a pipa<br />
So that it’s master heard lonely goose sounds every night<br />
The Han Autumn Moon song blurs the whole house<br /></p>

<p>The “lonely goose sounds” refers to a Chinese term 断雁 (<em>duan yan</em>), meaning a lonely goose that has lost its flock. This line suggests Chen Nianxi’s feelings of solitude and longing while living in isolating conditions as a migrant worker. This theme continues into the next line with the Han Autumn Moon song, a sympathetic song depicting the incredible melancholy a palace maid experiences as she faces the bright moon. The last line in the poem expands on this grim tone, as Chen Nianxi writes of the sun “wiping away” another day, suggesting a monotonous and wearisome reality he cannot break free from.</p>

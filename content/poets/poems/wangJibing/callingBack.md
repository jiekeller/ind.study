            I've received as many cold looks <br />
            as white clouds in the sky<br />
            The forced smiles I’ve given, these few bright things<br />
            have maintained a sunny sky for my life<br />
            I also have my own independent country<br />
            My boiling blood<br />
            is my flowing Yangtze river<br />
            My rugged, thin bones<br />
            are my towering mountains and rivers<br />
            My skin is vast like the yellow earth<br />
            and as bright as the stars in the sky<br />

            This poem speaks to not only the humility of migrant workers and the work they do, but also Wang Jibing’s belief in their significance and dignity. The poet first addresses the judgemental and cold looks he receives, presumably from others in society who have looked down on his social status. Wang Jibing takes this discrimination with a forced smile. Nevertheless, he maintains the dignity of a migrant worker, as seen in the rest of the poem. He writes,
                <div class="quotedpoetry" > 
                I also have my own independent country<br />
                My boiling blood<br />
                is my flowing Yangtze river<br />
                My rugged, thin bones<br />
                are my towering mountains and rivers<br />
                My skin is vast like the yellow earth<br />
                and as bright as the stars in the sky<br />
                </div>
            In these lines, the poet echoes a famous metaphor from migrant worker poet Chen Nianxi, which translates to “no matter how humble the bones, there are still rivers flowing.” In this comparison, the Chinese worker has the depth and complexity comparable to an independent state with towering mountains, flowing rivers and even bright stars in the sky. With this Wang Jibing argues, while they may sit at the lowest rung of the societal ladder, migrant workers have the depth of thought to find self-determination and self-expression.

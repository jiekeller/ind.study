            I’ve seen many funeral processions<br />
            This many years<br />
            Not one yet<br />
            is like the one I see now<br />
            So many people attending this funeral<br />
            and they cry with such emotion<br />
            Maybe the dead was <br />
            loved and respected by many<br />
            I can’t help to think<br />
            After I die<br />
            will there be this many people<br />
            crying for me, seeing me off<br />

            This shorter poem is emblematic of Xu Lizhi’s reckoning with his inevitable death and the isolation he has felt living as a migrant worker. Xu starts the poem by writing about the funeral he is currently seeing and the great many people who are weeping for the deceased. As the people cry with great emotion, Xu wonders about what kind of person the deceased was. The second half of the poem is a reflection on Xu’s own life as he questions whether or not this many people would attend his own funeral. Xu writes,
                <div class="quotedpoetry"> 
                I can’t help to think<br />
                After I die<br />
                Will there be this many people<br />
                Crying for me, seeing me off<br />
                </div>
            Similar to other poems he has written, Xu’s fixation on his inevitable death is chilling, given his suicide in 2014. Xu’s questioning of anyone attending his fated funeral is saddening and speaks to just how alone he feels as a migrant laborer.

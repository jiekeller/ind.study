            <p>
                As China has moved into the twenty-first century with rapid industrialization and economic development, migrant laborers have been caught in this development at the bottom of the social ladder. 
                They face hellish working conditions, isolating living arrangements, and a lack of social recognition. 
                To combat these hardships, some migrant workers have turned to poetry as an outlet to voice their plight and aspirations. 
                <br>
                On this website, I have translated and examined the poems of several contemporary Chinese migrant workers. 
                As these workers write for their voices to be heard, I have translated these poems for the general English speaking audience, to increase the readership and accessibility of this literature. 
                The poems I have selected contain a wide variety of themes, from collective spirit and togetherness, to death and feelings of isolation. The hardships endured by Chinese workers and the adversity they face life-or-death, as they fight for their lives, and that severity is reflected in many poems in this collection. 
                <br>
                At times, their writing contains aggressive and violent language, rich with cultural and historical references. At the same time, these worker poets depict vibrant and animated imagery, writing elegiac lines of poetry. 
                Please find my thoughts on the website and translation process below.

            <h2>Untranslatability: Challenges in translating Chinese poetry</h2>
            <p>
                Maghiel van Crevel has written of the difficulties of translating from the Chinese language, and in some cases, the untranslatability of Chinese poetry. Throughout this long-term research I have seen firsthand the issues of untranslatability that van Crevel argues. Most striking to me is how much of the ambiguity and three dimensionality of the poetry is lost and sacrificed in the translation to English. A poem that highlights this challenge is Chen Nianxi’s poem 爱人, which tells the story of a migrant worker struggling to leave their love while they travel far away for labor/work. At the end of the poem, Chen writes: 
                </p>
<p></p>
                <div class="quotedpoetry">
                    门缝里伸出剪刀<br>
                    把高岭剪成大路<br>
                    把路旁的树<br>
                    剪成我娘<br>
                </div>
                <p></p>
                If translated word by word, these lines translate to: “Scissors sticking out of the doorway, Cut the mountains into roads, And cut the trees on the roadside, Cut them into my mother.” However, this poem seems to abruptly end with the subject mentioning his mother. Having reached out to Chen Nianxi himself, it seems like these lines can hold two meanings. On the one hand the scissors can be seen as 目光 or sight, while on the other hand the scissors can be thought of more literally, cutting the mountains into highway and the tree into the subject’s mother to make their journey less tiresome. 
                Another poem of Chen Nianxi’s that highlights this theme of untranslatability is 帝国大厦... 
                <p></p>

                    这些我们共同的小学<br>
                    将教授风雨所有的课程<br>
                </div>
                <p></p>
                Like many languages and especially Chinese, there is a much deeper and multi-dimensional understanding of these poems before they are translated into English and become more straightforward. However, this loss is inevitable with translation, and the task of the translator is to carry the most important message from one language to another.

            <h2>Choices for this Website</h2>
            <p>
                For this website, given the sensitive nature of the poems and their often unofficial publications, I have chosen to include only my English translations and close readings, as well as the occasional stanza in Chinese. 
                Due to the many issues of copyright and unnecessary risks or challenges such as having images of the poets publically online, my website has truly focused on minimalist translations of these thought-provoking works.
                This was a difficult decision to make, but with the help of the Digital Humanities office at Macalester I feel confident in my choices both for the success of the website and well-being of these poets.

            Opening the door, I hear the voice of a child<br />
            He carefully lifts his head to look up at me<br />
            Turning back inside he shouts: Mom, that person is back, I haven’t seen him in a year<br />
            My son is still my son<br />
            My wife is still my wife<br />
            Only I<br />
            changed from “dad” into “migrant worker”<br />
            from “migrant worker” I have become “that person”<br />

            This heartbreaking poem by Wang Ji-Bing speaks to the isolating and alienating feeling of many migrant workers feel as they travel through China’s cities and towns. Wang suggests the time he has spent away from home as a migrant worker has detached himself from his own child. Upon arriving home, Wang’s son refers to him almost like a stranger in this poem. Wang illustrates how this work has stripped him of his individuality, personal title and even familiarity with his family members. While his child and wife stay the same, Wang Ji-Bing alone has transformed into merely a “migrant worker,” before even turning into “that person.”

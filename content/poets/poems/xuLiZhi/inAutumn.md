# In Autumn at Dusk
**By Xu Lizhi**

In Autumn at dusk<br />
I could be <br />
one shroud, one funeral wreath<br />
one coffin, one mourning hall<br />
one gravestone or one nameless grave<br />
But I am absolutely not<br />
one human<br />

---------------<br />

In this simple but powerful poem, Xu Lizhi reflects on the dehumanized state he sees himself in and ponders the different seemingly death related items he could be. A funeral wreath, a coffin or a nameless grave, these objects not only represent the lack of humanity Xu sees in himself as a migrant worker viewed by society, but also his lack of individuality and inevitable death. The juxtaposition of being a singular, one, individual object or place but not standing out or distinctive as he is a “nameless grave.” The title “In Autumn at Dusk” is often seen as a poetic image, but here Xu manipulates it to take on a subversive and morbid tone.

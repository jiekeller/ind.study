<p><strong>By Xu Lizhi</strong></p>

<p>I entered<br />
a vertical coffin<br />
As the coffin doors slowly closed<br />
this world and I<br />
were forever separated<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>Xu Lizhi’s poetry often employs symbols of urbanization to signify death and destruction. In this short poem “Elevator,” he compares the mechanical mode of transportation to a coffin. He writes,</p>

<p>As the coffin doors slowly closed<br />
this world and I<br />
were forever separated<br /></p>

<p>Xu poet flips such an integral part of modern technology to be instead thought of as a “vertical coffin,” capable of swallowing humans alive, and severing them from the world. Using this language, the poet speaks to just how detrimental modernization and the technology boom have been for migrant workers, with the elevator physically taking souls up and away from this world. Xu critiques the modernization of China, equating industrialization with death.</p>

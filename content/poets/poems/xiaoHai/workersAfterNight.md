# Workers After the Night Shift
**By Xiao Hai**

Leaving from the factory gate at 4:15AM <br />
The northern wind carries the cough of youth<br />
The hurried sound of footsteps all around<br />
<br />
Shandong scallion rolls, Xi’an mutton soup<br />
The peddling sounds of socks & warm pants<br />
And life’s demon<br />
A surprise raid showering down before dawn <br />
<br />
Under the bright milky way,       <br />
In the cold moonlight,  <br />
Face covered, the people rush about<br />
Like a deep winter snow<br />

            Following the sound of waves I arrived at this body of water <br />
            A person who has never been to the sea before<br />
            knows well what the ocean buries<br />
            The ocean can’t be demolished, but it can be polluted<br />
            like a modern history of civilization, full of marks of copulation<br />
            <br />
            This vast ocean<br />
            Transporting subcontract adidas shoes, sent by steel laborers towards the opposite shore<br />
            and confronting blue eyed foreigners’ fortified gun ships<br />
            Gun barrels filling up with the gunpowder made by our ancestors <br />
            Now it buries a poet and his mechanical youth worth less than his work station<br />
            Those twenty four years of an imprisoned soul lie here<br />
            is it given freedom?<br />
            <br />
            From Suiyang I set out hitchhiking <br />
            Hurriedly arriving at Zunyi airport, hitching a ride again in a giant beetle car to Shenzhen<br />
            I came to the ocean under the scorching sun, not arriving here to pay a visit<br />
            These years I have seen too many youths wither and die<br />
            They died in the ocean, died in the mountains, died on their way to a cold breeze and bright moon<br />
            Neither youth nor poem can change the filth and blue of the ocean<br />
            I am merely here to complete some parts of this life’s journey<br />
            Watching how a seagull flies on a frigid June day<br />
            <br />
            Where the sky meets the ocean<br />
            there is an invisible island<br />
            It is said in some years there once lived an immortal <br />
            now there lives an industrial boat<br />
            Big and tall palm trees wave on the waterfront<br />
            The turning clock has already gone amiss for many years<br />

            In this poem, Chen Nian-Xi uses the suicide of fellow migrant worker Xu Lizhi to denounce the globalization and industrialization of both China and the world that has led to the suffering and death of so many laborers. While Chen Nian-Xi blames the ocean directly, the true responsibility falls on the societies that have pushed this kind of factory-work and global commerce forward. Chen Nian-Xi writes of the confrontation between Chinese laborers and militant westerners caused by transnational trade:
                <div class="quotedpoetry"> 
                This vast ocean<br />
                Transporting adidas shoes, made by iron laborers, to the opposite shore<br />
                and bringing in blue eyed foreigners’ fortified gun ships<br />
                Gun barrels filling up with the gunpowder made by our ancestors <br />
                Now it buries a poet and his mechanical youth worth less than his work station<br />
                Those twenty four years of an imprisoned soul lie here<br />
                is it given freedom?<br />
                </div>
            This stanza illustrates what the ocean has beared witness to over hundreds of years, connecting the violence of the Opium Wars as well as China's rapid industrialization to Xu Lizhi's suicide. Chen Nian-Xi points to the gunpowder, created by the Chinese, yet eventually stolen and used  by Westerners in a conquest of Asia. Focusing on Xu Lizhi, Chen Nianxi calls out the deceased worker’s lack of perceived value in society. Chen Nian-Xi asserts that for all twenty-four years of his life, Xu Lizhi has been trapped within this society, his soul confined to the factory. In the concluding line, Chen Nian-Xi goes further to critique that even in death, Xu Lizhi’s soul may not be able to find freedom. With this critique, Chen Nian-Xi condemns both the society and the world.

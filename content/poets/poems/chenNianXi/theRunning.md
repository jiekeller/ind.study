            The children who run through the potholed Picun streets<br />
            They’re children of the poor, their<br />
            Stomach and intestines full of unprocessed food and sweet potato<br />
            How happy they are<br />
            Their joyfulness like a new cleaning rag<br />
            Ready to wipe away the old table in fall<br />
            <br />
            They still don’t know this world<br />
            How big it is, how much water is losing speed<br />
            Their mothers and fathers<br />
            Are on their way to work<br />
            A fall day <br />
            Makes the bikes on the street pedal faster<br />
            They are still powerless watching the West wind<br />
            Overpower the East wind<br />
            <br />
            Please allow me <br />
            to do one thing in my life<br />
            Please forgive me, I still accomplished nothing <br />
            Like these happy kids<br />
            Busy and ignorant,<br />
            brushing away the world’s dirt and grime<br />
            <br />
            The wind rises<br />
            The autumn wind bores through the scaffolding<br />
            Onto the laborers’ naked, bare necks <br />
            As if<br />
            the deceased are<br />
            putting a lace scarf on them <br />

            This poem by Chen Nianxi centers around his contemplation on the effects of migrant workers’ impoverished state on the children of these workers and the next generation. Unaware of the dangers, filth and stain of the world, these children are gleeful and happy. As they run by the Picun pothole street, Chen Nianxi sees them and thinks of himself. Frustrated that he has failed to amount to anything in life, Chen Nianxi compares himself to these ignorant, playful children. The poem concludes as the focus shifts to construction workers, suspended in the city’s scaffolding. The strong wind wraps around the laborer’s necks, almost as if their deceased fellow workers are placing scarves on them, keeping them warm in the cold autumn air.

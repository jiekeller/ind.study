# Pink
**By Xu Lizhi**

Pink
I picked out a tomb, in the urban village<br />
A long, long time ago,<br />
I liked her pink grave, and pink meadow<br />
Pink rivers and pink clouds <br />
For the rest of my life I’ll carry a pink illness<br />
and one day I will lie down in a pink coffin<br />
When the coffin lid slowly closes<br />
I will look directly up at the pink sky and the pink sun<br />
and let two pink tears, quietly roll down my cheeks<br />

---------------<br />


In this poem, Xu Li Zhi juxtaposes the beautiful color of pink with chilling illness and death. Xu envisions his own passing, used in pairing with pink to evoke a sickening, absurdist and grotesque feeling. In the conclusion of the poem, Xu views himself lying in the coffin, crying solemnly as he passes onto the next world. He writes,

and one day I will lie down in a pink coffin<br />
When the coffin lid slowly closes<br />
I will look directly up at the pink sky and the pink sun<br />
and let two pink tears, quietly roll down my cheeks<br />

In these lines it seems unusual and even unnatural for such a beautiful color to be paired with such unsettling imagery. This theme of his inevitable demise can be seen throughout Xu’s poetry, reflective of his belief in the lack of escape from poverty or self-determination as a migrant worker. This coupling of traditional beauty and disturbing imagination seizes the reader’s attention, making Xu Lizhi’s audience starkly aware of his struggle and inner turmoil.

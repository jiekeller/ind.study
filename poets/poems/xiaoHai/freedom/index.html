      <h1 id="freedom">自由(Freedom)</h1>
<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>A worker in a workshop searches for<br />
A peasant in the field searches for<br />
A politician in a meeting room on the conference table	searches for 		
freedom<br />
An honest person searches in the box for	<br />
A cunning person in a circle searches for<br />
A drunk searches in their wine cup for	<br />	
freedom<br />
People die on midsummer nights<br />
They say the goddess of freedom betrayed them<br />
I travel towards the South and the North<br />
Going to the bottom of the Atlantic ocean and the top of the Himalayas<br />
Searching below the Sun and in the Stars, searching every possible place, asking every person on the street I see, have you seen freedom?<br />
A prisoner has a face of sudden realization<br />
Quickly approaching a narrow iron door, hands moving down to their waist<br />
Falsely believing they can find the key to their freedom<br />
I went to see a friend I hadn’t seen in a long time<br />
He didn’t talk about dreams like he used to<br />
Only rambling on and on, not speaking a word about freedom<br />
I arrived downtown at dusk, planning to stop<br />
but it does not matter<br />
I saw a barber fixing up the beauty and ugliness of the mundane world<br />
just covering up their own hypocrisy <br />
Street lights that look like God’s eyes, cars rumble, making frantic judgements<br />
Those incomplete dreams, one after another racing along the street
I ask the bright moon,<br />
do you have the freedom to completely wash away the filth of this world?<br />
The shadow of Satan moves across the bustling streets<br />
A beggar taps at his bowl of coins<br />
letting out delirious ravings, trying to find freedom in there<br />
My neighbor Siddhartha Guatama, he said freedom is not only letting go<br />
He was willing to speak about freedom again, saying I must light incense first<br />
He suggested sometimes freedom is the Karma that binds life together<br />
I’ve passed through a desert to arrive at a prairie<br />
Running into the daughter of an angel and a demon<br />
She sat on the head of a running, skittish horse <br />
wearing gorgeous clothing, with a confused gaze<br />
I ride a pure white cloud like riding the wall above the bed<br />
Focusing on the grazing flock of sheep <br />
but understanding nothing<br />
Who once said those things about freedom?<br />
…..<br />
Some people wave the golden credit card in front of my eyes<br />
saying freedom is in the card<br />
I immediately get caught up in ignorant silence<br />
Perhaps I never understood that freedom<br />
In the final sunset, I gaze off into the distance<br />
Chasing after the last bus<br />
Holding onto the last inaudible breath of air <br />
I don’t know, I really don’t know<br />
in the end what can I do, to finally achieve freedom?<br />
<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>This poem directly questions how not only a migrant worker, but also everyone in Chinese society, could find freedom in their daily lives. Xiao Hai argues that even those that hold a higher place in society haven’t achieved full self-determination either. He goes further to scrutinize the values of society, speaking to what politicians, beggars and even businessmen look for to find the so-called “freedom.” Throughout the poem, Xiao Hai continues to search for this freedom, first geographically, then religiously and even personally. However, he can’t find it, and while Xiao Hai notes that some claim to find freedom through capitalism and wealth, that is not enough for him. The last few lines illustrate Xiao Hai’s frustrations: <br />
<br />
In the final sunset, I gaze off into the distance<br />
Chasing after the last bus<br />
Holding onto the last inaudible breath of air <br />
I don’t know, I really don’t know<br />
In the end what can I do, to finally achieve freedom?<br />
<br />
The last line is almost defeatist in tone. As much as Xiao Hai could try to chase after this self-determination, even in his last moments he can’t achieve this autonomy. He may feel that, no matter what, migrant workers truly have no means of social and economic mobility.</p>

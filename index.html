                    With the help of the Mellon-Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, I have researched and translated Chinese migrant worker poetry over the last year and a half. <br>
                    <br>
                    This digital collection contains a total of fourty four translated poems, and I provide close readings of every poem to assist the reader in understanding this complex poetry.<br>
                    <br>
                    As these migrant workers give voice to the human rights issues they face in modern China, I find it important to translate their works and amplify their voice to as wide of an audience as possible.

# Waiting for Snow
**By Li Ruo**

I’m waiting for a snowfall <br />
A huge snowfall <br />
Please, god<br />
let the snow fall!<br />
A big snowfall can bury everything<br />

One winter without a decent snowfall<br />
Can it still be called a winter?<br />
Please<br />
God! Let the snow fall<br />
Don’t let the heavy snow<br />
miss us this season<br />

Please<br />
let it snow once this year<br />

In this short poem, Li Ruo prays to nature in hope of a big snowfall. This poem reflects some of the more mundane and everyday wishes of migrant workers. While some poems hold a heavier, more intense tone, a poem like this reflects the day-to-day thoughts Li Ruo has in the winter. Perhaps this winter snow can return Li Ruo to the feelings of childhood and youth, an escape from the monotonous life she lives today.

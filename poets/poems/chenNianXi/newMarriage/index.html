            With regards to the North<br />
            the Mid Autumn Festival is already in late autumn<br />
            With regards to the Henan woodworker Wang Liangmu<br />
            the Mid Autumn Festival is destiny’s spring equinox<br />
            Today, he married<br />
            The new girl from Sichuan<br />
            Although accurately speaking she came from the end of the assembly line<br />
            Multiple wooden beds, started from Wang Liangmu<br />
            finished at Zhang Xiaoqin<br />
            It’s hard for the husband and wife to love without a bed<br />
            Zhang Xiaoqin carefully polishes the edges and corners<br />
            Zhang Xiaoqin paints the night and day spring river pattern <br />
            Becoming this city Yunzhang’s location<br />
            Five flavors of food and three rounds of drinks<br />
            The moonlight rises up from the East<br />
            Those who celebrated leave one after another<br />
            In the brand new home the bed is bright<br />
            In the west window under the bright moon sit the new couple<br />
            They look somewhat old-fashioned<br />
            Mid-Autumn Night 2016<br />
            Beijing is windy, Chaoyang street has heavy traffic<br />
            Some stand trial, others are celebrated<br />
            Others die on Chenzhou street and those who pass by are too busy to care <br />
            In the corner on the floor a new couple starts an old life<br />
            A bed is quietly removed<br />
            It must return before daybreak<br />
            to the woodworking factory showroom<br />

            The emotional and vivid storytelling Chen Nianxi spins in this poem captivates readers with a tale of love and labor. Two migrant workers, on opposite ends of the assembly line, find marriage and romance in their static, industrial workplace. Chen Nianxi paints the image of workers in the factory coming together to celebrate the wedding of two migrants. Food and drink is prepared, and the workers celebrate before leaving the newlyweds to share their first night together. The poet concludes the poem, first referencing the sickness and apathy of today’s society, before hinting at an intimate night between the couple. While pointing to the moral failures of society, Chen Nianxi leaves the reader with a sweet and private moment between two migrant workers. He highlights that even in such an ailing society, migrant workers can still succeed at finding moments of love and intimacy.

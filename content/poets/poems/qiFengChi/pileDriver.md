            The tunneling machine conceals its arm in the coal bed<br />
            The pile driver immediately extends the arm hidden in its sleeve<br />
            Extending both of its arms and raising the large dark area above its head<br />
            The soldier blows up the bunker<br />
            Holding up the battle<br />
            All of the pile drivers extend both arms<br />
            Supplying the warmth humanity needs<br />
            The pile drivers line up in an orderly fashion<br />
            Pushing life and sweat towards the dark end<br />
            The soldier blows up the bunker<br />
            Shouting loudly<br />
            “For the new China, push forward!”<br />
            The pile driver holding up half of the earth<br />
            Not daring to take a breath<br />

            In this poem, Qi references a People’s Liberation Army soldier, Dong Cunrui 董存瑞, who sacrificed his life to defeat the Nationalist forces. Dong’s sacrifice was incredibly noble, Qi utilizes his name in this context to both criticize the sacrifices demanded of migrant workers and also valorize their effort and labor. Although this translation leaves out Dong Cunrui by name from the poem, this will allow for a more easily understood and accessible reading for Westerners. Qi compares the commonplace pile driver machinery used by laborers today to the heroic Dong Cunrui who detonated explosives to kill multiple KMT soldiers and in the process gave his own life. Since his death, Dong’s story has been used in extensive PRC propaganda and even published in Chinese elementary textbooks. Qi writes,
                <div class="quotedpoetry" > 
                Pushing life and sweat towards the dark end<br />
                The soldier blows up the bunker<br />
                Shouting loudly<br />
                “For the new China, push forward!”<br />
                The pile driver holding up half of the earth<br />
                Not daring to take a breath<br />

            This comparison by Qi Feng-Chi not only highlights the erosion of body and mind made by migrant workers in China for the development of the country, but at the same time also lifts up the significance of migrant labor to a level of heroism. This allegory links the work and hardships of migrant workers to something as grave and noble as self-immolation in wartime. Qi’s poem resoundingly challenges what is called upon, and endured by China’s working class, while simultaneously celebrating its contributions to society.

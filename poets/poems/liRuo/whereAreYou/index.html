            How I want<br />
            to be with you<br />
            Standing in the snow<br />
            Hair turning white<br />
            That way there won’t be any worry<br />
            about our separation<br />
            <br />
            You look at me<br />
            I look at you<br />
            Like statues<br />
            In a moment that feels like forever<br />
            The fluttering snow<br />
            is my wedding dress<br />
            <br />
            We could still<br />
            be together<br />
            and make a snowman<br />
            Or have a snowball fight<br />
            but<br />
            where are you?<br />

            In this poem, Li Ruo explores her tense emotion and longing for her missing beloved. Standing in the snow, she contemplates the joy and romance she and her loved one could experience together, but her love is nowhere to be found. This theme of longing, and separation from a loved one can be seen throughout migrant worker poetry. The translocation life of migrant laborers has likely caused a separation, and she can only imagine and envision sharing a moment with them.

                How I want<br />
                to be with you<br />

                Hair turning white<br />

            With such displacement, Li Ruo expresses the anxiety and worry that comes with long-distance romance. While straightforward, this poem demonstrates the difficulties of love among migrant workers. The disconnection between these laborers and their partners pushes their use of imagination to stoke their intimacy and remain connected from afar.

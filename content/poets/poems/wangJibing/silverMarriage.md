# Silver Marriage
**By Wang Jibing**

My beloved, we arenâ€™t poor<br />
The moonlight has gone through the cracked glass window<br />
turning the room to silver<br />
It piles up on our small, wooden, wire frame bed<br />
Your hair and quiet snore<br />
has the worth of precious gold<br />


---------------<br />

Wang Ji-Bing seemingly attempts to convince his wife of their immaterial fortune in this poem, arguing for the priceless value of their love and intimacy. Wang first compares the moonlight entering their bedroom to silver, as it envelopes the room in a shining glow. More importantly than that, Wang professes his partner has the hair, and even the snore of precious gold. While short, this poem demonstrates how Wang Ji-Bing strives to find value and affluence, in a life lacking materialistic wealth.

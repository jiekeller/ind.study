# Father
**By Li Ruo**

When I was little<br />
and ate noodles<br />
The noodles would be too long<br />
I would bite them into pieces and put them in the bowl one by one<br />
Not even able to eat more than half<br />
You would eat the rest<br />
of the half bowl of noodles<br />
My father<br />

When I was little<br />
I would eat <br />
and play <br />
I accidentally<br />
dropped the bowl on the ground, breaking it in two<br />
Mom angrily said<br />
this evening you’ll just use this broken bowl to eat<br />
When it was time for dinner<br />
I stubbornly insisted on<br />
using the broken half of the bowl to eat<br />
You nervously watched me eat<br />
My father<br />

When I was little<br />
The house was too busy<br />
You and mom sent me away to Grandma’s<br />
She would make me go call Grandpa for dinner<br />
When crossing the bridge<br />
I would misbehave again<br />
Walking on the skinny railing<br />
a gust of wind blew<br />
I fell from the tall bridge<br />
Hearing the news<br />
you cried<br />
My father<br />

Now<br />
I’ve grown up<br />
But you are not here anymore<br />
My father<br />

In this short poem, Li Ruo conveys her love for her father, recalling childhood stories that reflect his kindness and care for her. The poet uses the two stanzas to paint a picture of the mundane and everyday life she had growing up, each story impacted by her father’s love for her. Li Ruo writes,

Not even able to eat more than half<br />
You would eat the rest<br />
of the half bowl of noodles<br />
My father<br />

The father daughter bond in this poem is displayed in her father’s careful attention as Li Ruo ate out of the broken bowl, seen in the second stanza. The other two short memories in this poem exemplify this theme, as Li Ruo recalls her father's kindness and concern for her. In all stanzas, Li Ruo ends with ‘My father,’ expressing her emotional connection, love and appreciation for her late father now that she has reached adulthood.

            Waiting for the traffic to give me an opportunity<br />
            I want to cross Street 107<br />
            then follow the border<br />
            Holding my ID card<br />
            Waiting in line to enter the South gate<br />
            This weekend I dressed beautifully<br />
            I want to walk South<br />
            towards this city’s center<br />
            I want to be careful of the flowers I walk over<br />
            Like a king palm tree, standing by the road<br />
            Keeping equal distance from each other<br />
            I just stand like this<br />
            I’m only just following this city’s rules<br />
            Only then can I stand here in this position<br />
            Only then is this city beautiful<br />
            Only then I might be beautiful<br />

            In “Rules,” Wu Xia draws a comparison between the tall palm trees she sees in the city and the rigid expectations and regulations of living in that city. The poem begins with the subject waiting eagerly to cross Street 107 in hopes of reaching the city center, reflecting the desire and need of migrant workers to find labor in China's urban areas. As the subject describes these king palm trees, the stiff and immutable placement of every tree symbolizes the expectations and necessities of fitting into Chinese society. As Wu writes in the end, 
                <div class="quotedpoetry"> 
                I’m only just following this city’s rules<br />
                Only then can I stand here in this position<br />
                Only then is this city beautiful<br />
                Only then I might be beautiful<br />
                </div>
            These four lines encapsulate the poem's meaning:The poet has to follow the rules of the city, only then can she find her proper  place to stand. Wu Xia argues that one can only succeed and be deemed of worth if they follow the rigid guidelines and standards, the “rules” of this society.

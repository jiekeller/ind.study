            All the elderly in the village say<br />
            I look a lot like my grandfather when he was young<br />
            In the beginning I didn’t believe it so<br />
            Later, they mentioned it again and again<br />
            I’m convinced<br />
            me and my grandfather<br />
            not only look more and more alike<br />
            Even our habits and interests<br />
            are like we came out of the same womb together<br />
            For instance, my grandfather’s nickname is bamboo<br />
            mine is coat hanger<br />
            My grandfather often held his anger in silence<br />
            I’m often a yes-man<br />
            My grandfather liked to solve riddles<br />
            I like to make prophecies<br />
            In Autumn of 1943, Japanese devils entered the village<br />
            My grandfather burned to death<br />
            He lived to be 23<br />
            This year, I turned 23<br />

            One theme that appears in many of Xu Lizhi’s poems is his inevitable death and departure from this world. This writing combined with his suicide in 2014 generates an incredibly dark and haunting feel to this poem titled, “A Kind of Prophecy.” In this poem, Xu Lizhi speaks of his destiny to die as well as the cycle of death he observes. The concluding lines ominously predict his own demise,
                <div class="quotedpoetry">

                </div>
            With that last line, it is almost as if Xu seals his fate himself, repeating history and mirroring his grandfather’s life in appearance, hobbies, interests and even in death. He cannot escape his predetermined destiny, even if he tried.  This theme inevitably speaks to the social immobility of migrant workers, and cyclical, lack of self-determination that Xu Lizhi has experienced.

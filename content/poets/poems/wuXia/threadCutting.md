# Thread-Cutting Woman
**By Wu Xia**

I sit upright, cutting thread<br />
Right hand grasping a small pair of scissors<br />
Left hand holding the top of the thread<br />
Time was cut with a snip<br />

I feel uneasy<br />
Afraid I will break my self-esteem accidentally<br />
I’ve learned to hide the truth<br />
and conceal gaps flawlessly<br />

Unfolding my right hand<br />
It’s covered in calluses, sweat and rust<br />
For a moment I’m powerless to resist<br />
but still must clench my fists<br />

Making countless cuts<br />
Cutting endless nostalgic and emotional threads<br />
Cutting them off one by one<br />
Youth lies scattered on the ground, just like thread<br />

In “Thread-Cutting Woman,” the poet uses the interesting comparison of thread cutting to exemplify her  feelings of wasted youth. Throughout the poem, Wu Xia depicts the mundane task of cutting thread, the posture required of it, and the hand movement involved with it. The end of the first stanza, “Time was cut with a snip,” dramatically speaks to the loss of time Wu Xia has experienced. Wu Xia finishes this thought at the end of the poem,

Making countless cuts<br />
Cutting endless nostalgic and emotional threads<br />
Cutting them off one by one<br />
Youth lies scattered on the ground, just like thread<br />

By ending with this striking imagery, Wu Xia completes this metaphor hinted at in previous stanzas. The worker poet's emotional ties and precious youth have been cut and snipped endlessly over time, left to be forgotten on the ground like thread. While many other migrant workers discuss their lost youth in poetry, Wu Xia’s metaphor of misspent youth is both impressive and disturbing.

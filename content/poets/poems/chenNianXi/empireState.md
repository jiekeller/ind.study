            I’ve always been disgusted by massive things<br />
            The sky of my childhood is full of clenched fists, held high<br />
            Some absurd sounds soaring to the sky<br />
            A towering statue filled the whole country<br />
            I certainly do not love the Empire State Building<br />
            It really is that tall<br />
            it is said to have one hundred and two floors<br />
            An iron will and a marble dream in one body<br />
            Among the metal some perhaps came from my demolition work in China<br />
            Now, I stand on its highest viewing deck<br />
            The cold wind blowing from all sides<br />
            making me more anxious: Empire, what do you want?<br />
            Looking down through the steel fence<br />
            A river surrounds New York<br />
            A few small and light ships surf the river<br />
            They haven’t started their motors, just arriving where they want to go<br />
            Pregnant women from the streets walk by<br />
            These elementary schools of ours<br />
            will teach us all the courses of life’s hardships<br />

                Chen Nianxi uses this poem to generate an interesting allegory between China and the US, centered around the cultural revolution. Chen Nianxi starts by attesting to his distaste for large things, comparing the many statues and posters of Mao walked triumphantly through the streets during the cultural revolution to the towering figure of the Empire State Building. Chen Nianxi questions the goals and behavior of empires like China and the US:

                Chen Nianxi seems to hold significant disdain for the two global superpowers, displeased with both countries’ morals, societies and powerful figures. Furthermore, he suggests these two states may not be so different as they claim to be. While the US and China differ in many ways, Chen Nianxi sees similarities in many things, even the metal used to build the Empire State Building. While this comparison is striking, the second half of the poems takes a completely different tone. The poet describes the boats, people and streets he sees at the top of the skyscraper, before concluding the poem with two disconnected lines. This difference in tone leaves the reader confused, however, Chen Nianxi’s distinct perspective in the first half of the poem asks important questions in today’s geopolitical landscape.

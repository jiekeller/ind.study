<p><strong>By Xu Duo</strong></p>

<p>I don’t want to lament youth’s passing<br />
I don’t want to weep alone in a strange land<br />
I want to remember Ma’s embrace when I left home<br />
Remember the journey my luggage took<br />
Life is just a battle<br />
You must be strong willed, not fearing self-sacrifice<br />
The moon of a strange land keeps its eyes open<br />
Those of us like weeds are stubborn from birth<br /></p>

<p>An unspoken impenetrable mountain pass of iron<br />
Now we take a step from the very beginning<br />
Together, we are a bright ball of fire<br />
Scattered, we are a sky full of stars<br />
Life is a never ending battle<br />
Expending one’s whole life, burning, to light the journey<br />
If wildflowers bloom abundantly on that hill <br />
that will be my most brilliant smile<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>This poem, also song lyrics, exemplifies self-sacrifice, solidarity and strength, carrying a much more positive energy than many other migrant worker poems. The songwriting context of his poems causes many of Xu Duo’s poems to hold more optimism than other migrant workers’ poems. He writes of the iron will of migrant workers, standing rooted and strong against the challenges and sorrows of translocational labor. Xu Duo references Mao Ze Dong’s words,</p>

<p>Now we take a step from the very beginning<br />
Together, we are a bright ball of fire<br /></p>

<p>This imagery he borrows from Mao’s poems signifies the collective strength of the proletariat, Nevertheless, Xu Duo uses it to call on the collective strength of migrant workers all over China in the new era. Xu Duo’s willingness for self-sacrifice is also apparent. Like the title states, life and factory work is a battle for Xu Duo, and one that he accepts despite its difficulties. Even if he must expend his whole life, “burning, to light the journey,” and lead other migrant workers, Xu Duo will do this with a brilliant smile for the future success of laborers.</p>

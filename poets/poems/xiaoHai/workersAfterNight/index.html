<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>Leaving from the factory gate at 4:15AM <br />
The northern wind carries the cough of youth<br />
The hurried sound of footsteps all around<br />
<br />
Shandong scallion rolls, Xi’an mutton soup<br />
The bargaining sounds of socks &amp; warm pants<br />
and life’s demon<br />
A surprise attack before dawn <br />
<br />
Under the bright milky way,       <br />
In the cold moonlight,  <br />
Face covered, the people rush about<br />
Like a deep winter snow<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>This poem gives a snapshot of the daily challenges faced by migrant workers. While the majority of the poem describes the monotonous and the mundane experienced by many laborers, The last stanza of this poem takes this everyday occurrence and turns it into highly poetic imagery. Xiao Hai paints a vivid image of workers when they step outside of the factory gates in the morning:<br /></p>

<p>Under the bright milky way, <br /> 
In the cold moonlight,  <br />
Face covered, the people rush about<br />
Like a deep winter snow<br /></p>

<p>As the many workers rush about under the stars, their movement and speed resembles a flurry of snowflakes. While laboring under harsh, inhumane hours, Xiao Hai uses the imagery of monotonous movements and produces a beautiful and vivid ending. This ending juxtaposed with the rest of the poem causes a rupture, with starkly different language from the dry stanzas above it.</p>

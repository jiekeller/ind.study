      <h1 id="this-city">This City…</h1>
<p><strong>By Xu Lizhi</strong></p>

<p>This city rises slowly in ruins<br />
Tearing down China’s traditions and the bones of our ancestors <br />
This city stuffs the factory into the worker’s stomach<br />
Continuously injecting industrial waste water into their dry veins<br />
This city has never changed AIDS syringe needles<br />
This city makes gynecology and urology hospitals have intercourse every night<br />
Making every person carry condoms, sanitary towels, viagra and abortion pills with them<br />
Making every person suffer from pelvic inflammation, cervix inflammation and uterus inflammation<br />
Cervix erosions, impotence, premature ejaculation, prostatitis, genital warts and infertility<br />
This city chants red songs and reads red documents and bleeds bright red blood<br />
This city and its money kills morality, while power buries the law<br />
This city has all five internal organs, and all five internal organs have turned rotten<br />
This city’s ghetto and downtown are a million miles apart<br />
This city’s people kneel at the feet of the public officials<br />
This city hears the sound of music and singing every night, while dignity and kindness rot on the street<br />
High class clubs hide politicians wine and prostitutes<br />
This city starves Li Bai to death, while the pop song gains success and recognition<br />
This city’s supposed age is 1980—2013<br />
This city’s real age is 1966—1976<br /></p>

<p>In this poem, Xu Lizhi points to urbanization as destruction and death. The rise of this metropolis that Xu Lizhi writes of, develops as a result of destroying the traditions, history and memory of ancestors. Xu Lizhi connects this development of modern China to the Cultural Revolution period, arguing for it as a root cause of China’s current poisoned society. Xu writes,</p>

<p>This city in ruins rises slowly<br />
Tearing down the bones of the motherland’s traditions and ancestors<br />
This city stuffs the factory into the worker’s stomach<br />
Continuously injecting industrial waste water into their dry veins<br />
This city has never changed AIDS syringe needles<br />
…<br />
Making every person carry condoms, sanitary towels, viagra and plan B with them
Making every person suffer from pelvic inflammation, cervix inflammation and uterus inflammation</p>

<p>While in other poems Xu reflects on the psychological impact of migrant labor, in this poem Xu theorizes its physical effects. The rot and degradation of workers because of the city is incredibly gruesome. The city pumps waste and the cement of buildings into workers, leaving them with injuries and a multitude of genitalia related afflictions. The effect of urbanization on the people of this society is sickening, and Xu Lizhi accuses China’s Maoist period as the source of this suffering.</p>

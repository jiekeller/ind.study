# Guerrillas in the Winter
**By Xu Duo**

Hey friends, face this winter<br />
We are only guerrilla fighters<br />
Remember to take your gun with you<br />
before you are forced to leave<br />

Ah, the past is soon to be erased<br />
The future far away on the horizon, has been changed again<br />
Stranded in the present<br />
we are already in an enduring guerrilla war<br />

Rushing about in this world<br />
Behind the wildfire in the back, it burns and burns, endlessly <br />
Life is vast and hazy, <br />
but a single spring breeze can make it renewed again<br />
Despair in one hand, blazing, flourishing life in the other<br />

Hey lover, the world is heroic<br />
Those passionate times have already burned up<br />
We have survived to this day<br />
Genuinely seeing each other<br />

Oh, this city cannot grow love anymore<br />
In the mountains and rivers we dance freely<br />
The rest of our shared life<br />
is already joyful youth<br />

Rushing about in this world<br />
Behind the wildfire in the back, it burns and burns, endlessly <br />
Life is vast and hazy, <br />
but a single spring breeze can make it renewed again<br />
Despair on one hand, blazing, flourishing life on the other<br />

We are prepared to walk the highway<br />
We are prepared to walk the trail<br />
We are prepared to walk the straight road, the winding road, the night road<br />
Walking through the day is the night road<br />
Walking through the night is the bright road<br />

We walk up the sloping road<br />
We walk down the sloping road<br />
We walk the slanting road, the fork in the road, the dead end road<br />
The end of the world still has a road<br />
and when we reach the dead end road we still find another road<br />
The end the world still has a road<br />
and when we reach the dead end road we carry on<br />

In this poem and song, Xu Duo draws a comparison between migrant workers and guerrilla fighters, as the laborers are resiliently fighting back against the system that has oppressed them for years. Like many of Xu Duo’s other poem/song lyrics, there is a strong positive and subversive spirit. Xu Duo confidently assures the reader of the great sacrifices migrant workers are willing to make in the fight for their self-determination. Throughout the poem, Xu Duo writes

Life is vast and hazy, <br />
but a single spring breeze can make it renewed again<br />
Despair in one hand, blazing, flourishing life in the other<br />

In the first line above, the character 苍茫 literally translates to mean “boundless,” a term used by Mao Zedong in his speeches to express Mao’s confidence in the future of the proletariat revolution. This character however, I translated into “vast,” and played more into the positive and negative aspects of life. This Maoist language and range in tone shown in the lines above speak to Xu Duo’s belief in the future of migrant workers’ collective success. Although they face many challenges today, just as Xu Duo writes, “a single spring breeze” may be all it takes to shift migrant workers towards a brighter future.

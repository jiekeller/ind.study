            The plum blossom sits in the corner<br />
            Facing the start of autumn alone<br />
            The one who has planted plum trees<br />
            Has already left many years ago<br />
            <br />
            The strong autumn wind blows into the spring wind<br />
            Hidden deeply in the branches, things in life always happen like this<br />
            life and death hold one another<br />
            Like spring water filling up a well overnight, when some of us leave our hometown<br />
            <br />
            Remember that year I went to your home to see you<br />
            We didn’t have a single piece of clothing to wrap our youth in<br />
            Today, I wear a fine suit<br />
            But my body is empty and hollow<br />

            Plum blossoms often represent resilience, perseverance and enduring hardship in Chinese culture. However, in this poem, the plum blossom exposes many cruel aspects of reality and a loss of youth and vitality by the subject. The last stanza of the poem illuminates Chen Nianxi’s critique of simultaneous material acquisition and emotional loss. He writes,
                <div class="quotedpoetry"> 
                Remember that year I went to your home to see you
                We didn’t have a single piece of clothing to wrap our youth in
                Today, I wear a fine suit
                But my body is empty and hollow
                </div>
            While before the subject did not have decent clothing, now he does as indicated by his expensive suit. However, Chen Nianxi ends with chilling lines, speaking to the lack of soul he possesses as a result of this material . With this Chen Nianxi, testifies to the sacrifice of morals, character and companions that are made to achieve prosperity and climb the economic ladder.

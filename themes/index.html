        The poets write of a wide array of themes in their poetry, I have focused on a few of these themes below.

                <h2>Untranslatability</h2>
                <p>
                    Maghiel van Crevel has written of the difficulties of translating from the Chinese language, and in some cases, the untranslatability of Chinese poetry. Throughout this long-term research I have seen firsthand the issues of untranslatability that van Crevel argues. Most striking to me is how much of the ambiguity and three dimensionality of the poetry is lost and sacrificed in the translation to English. A poem that highlights this challenge is Chen Nianxi’s poem 爱人, which tells the story of a migrant worker struggling to leave their love while they travel far away for labor/work. At the end of the poem, Chen writes: 
                    </p>
<p></p>
                    门缝里伸出剪刀<br>
                    把高岭剪成大路<br>
                    把路旁的树<br>
                    剪成我娘<br>
                    <p></p>
                    If translated word by word, these lines translate to: “Scissors sticking out of the doorway, Cut the mountains into roads, And cut the trees on the roadside, Cut them into my mother.” However, this poem seems to abruptly end with the subject mentioning his mother. Having reached out to Chen Nianxi himself, it seems like these lines can hold two meanings. On the one hand the scissors can be seen as 目光 or sight, while on the other hand the scissors can be thought of more literally, cutting the mountains into highway and the tree into the subject’s mother to make their journey less tiresome. 
                    Another poem of Chen Nianxi’s that highlights this theme of untranslatability is 帝国大厦... 
                    <p></p>
                    这些我们共同的小学<br>
                    将教授风雨所有的课程<br>
                    <p></p>
                    Like many languages and especially Chinese, there is a much deeper and multi-dimensional understanding of these poems before they are translated into English and become more straightforward. However, this loss is inevitable with translation, and the task of the translator is to carry the most important message from one language to another.

                <h2>Death and the Cycle of Death in Xu Lizhi's Poetry</h2>
                Xu Lizhi’s poetry is incredibly interesting in its gory, dark, death- focused themes as well as its difference from the greater MWP canon because of these themes. The isolation, loneliness and impending death that Xu Lizhi feels not only for himself but his fellow migrant workers can be seen in every single poem he has crafted. Specifically, theis topics of death, blood, and bodily harm appears in many ways throughout Xu’s poetry. 
                <p></p>
                The theme of his inevitable death and departure from this world appears consistently throughout. This writing combined with his suicide in 2014 is incredibly dark and haunting to think about. One poem that specifically highlights Xu Lizhi’s destiny to die as well as the cycle of death he observes is “A Kind of Prophecy.” Xu concludes the poem by ominously predicting his own death,
                <p></p>
                My grandfather liked to solve riddles<br>
                I like to make prophecies<br>
                In Autumn of 1943, Japanese devils entered the village<br>
                My grandfather burned to death<br>
                He lived to be 23
                This year, I turned 23<br>
                <p></p>
                With that last line, it is almost as if Xu seals his fate himself, repeating history and mirroring his grandfather’s life in appearance, hobbies, interests and even in death. This theme inevitably speaks to just how trapped and motionless migrant workers feel in the factories they work and live in. Another powerful example is  “Pink,” a poem where the beautiful color of pink is juxtaposed with themes of chilling illness and death:
                <p></p>
                And one day I will lie down in a pink coffin<br>
                When the coffin lid slowly closes<br>
                I will look directly up at the pink sky and the pink sun<br>
                And let two pink tears, quietly roll down my cheeks<br>
                <p></p>
                Xu places himself in the coffin at the end of this poem, crying solemnly as he passes onto the next world. Xu again envisions his own death, using the color pink to evoke a sickening, absurdist and grotesque feeling. It seems unusual and even unnatural for such a beautiful color to be paired with such upsetting imagery. 
                A different powerful theme of Xu Lizhi’s poetry, his usage of symbols of urbanization to signify death and destruction, can be seen in his poem “Elevator,” where he compares this mechanical mode of transportation to a coffin.
                <p></p>
                I entered<br>
                A vertical coffin<br>
                As the coffin doors slowly closed<br>
                This world and I<br>
                Were forever separated<br>
                <p></p>
                Such an integral part of modern technology is flipped to be thought of as a “vertical coffin,” capable of swallowing humans alive, and severing them from the world. Using this language, Xu Lizhi speaks to just how detrimental China’s modernization and technology boom has been for migrant workers, with the elevator physically taking souls up and away from this world. Another example of this urbanization as destruction and death is visible in Xu’s poem “This city…”:
                <p></p>
                This city in ruins rises slowly<br>
                Tearing down the bones of the motherland’s traditions and ancestors<br>
                This city stuffs the factory into the worker’s stomach<br>
                Continuously injecting industrial waste water into their dry veins<br>
                This city has never changed AIDS syringe needles<br>
                …<br>
                Making every person carry condoms, sanitary towels, viagra and plan B with them<br>
                Making every person suffer from pelvic inflammation, cervix inflammation and uterus inflammation<br>
                <p></p>
                While in other poems Xu reflects on the mental effect of migrant labor, in this poem Xu theorizes the physical effects of being a laborer. The physical rot and degradation of workers because of the city is incredibly gruesome here. The city pumps waste and the cement of buildings into workers, leaving them with injuries and a multitude of copulation related complications. 
                <p></p>
                While his poetry may not be reflective of the larger Migrant Worker poetry canon, Xu Lizhi’s poetry is fascinating and chilling to read as he reflects on dark themes of degradation and death caused by China’s economic engine. Death consumed his life and consumed his poetry. It is heartbreaking to see just how detrimental the working environment he inhabited affected him.

            Prepared and on standby<br />
            Waiting quietly for orders<br />

            In this poem, Xu Lizhi compares the numerous workers standing along the assembly line to Qin Dynasty Terracotta Warriors, suggesting not only the lack of autonomy of these workers but also the impending death they face. Xu Lizhi lists off the equipment worn by the workers, almost as if it is armor and weaponry to be worn by soldiers going into battle. Xu writes,
                <div class="quotedpoetry" > 
                Prepared and on standby<br />
                Waiting quietly for orders<br />
                With one ring of the bell<br />
                they all return to the Qin<br />
                </div>
            By comparing migrant workers to these ancient warriors, whose sole purpose was to protect the emperor in the afterlife, Xu suggests migrant workers also have a sole purpose to mechanically provide for their country’s production. Furthermore, as these soldiers are destined to leave the mortal world to travel with the emperor into the afterlife, Xu also insinuates the morbid future of migrant workers along the assembly line. This poem illustrates Xu Lizhi’s belief in migrant workers’ lack of autonomy as well as his belief in migrant workers' predestined demise.

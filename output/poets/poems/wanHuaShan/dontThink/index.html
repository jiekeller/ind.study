      <h1 id="dont-think-i-am-alone">Don’t Think I am Alone</h1>
<p><strong>By Wan Hua Shan</strong></p>

<p>Don’t think I am alone<br />
I carry the stones of mountains and rivers back home<br />
they become my hardened bones<br />
The wild roses still swaying in the yellow earth<br />
Intertwined with the road I want to take back home in my dreams<br /></p>

<p>Don’t think I am alone<br />
I carry the old roof corroded by the wind and rain<br />
Keeping me safe from the heavy frost<br />
The noodle soup that warms the stomach<br />
washes away sorrows on cold nights<br /></p>

<p>Don’t think I am alone<br />
With the young woman, we wave goodbye in the sunset’s glow<br />
The departing melancholy of leaving the scornful city<br />
And the old ox, wading through water down by the river at dusk<br />
carries my worldly troubles on his back<br /></p>

<p>Don’t think I am alone<br />
My fellow workers come from all over the motherland<br />
They carry all kinds of companionship with them <br />
Using our callous fingers<br />
we play together, making music in the lonely wilderness<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>In this illustrative poem, Wan Hua-Shan begins each stanza with “Don’t think I am alone,” indicative of how he courageously sustains a sense of unity and comradeship throughout the isolating life of a migrant worker. The subject of the poem finds solidarity in the objects he carries with him, the other migrants he works with and even the ox he tends to all along his travels. The poem concludes with a vivid image of migrant workers playing music together,</p>

<p>Don’t think I am alone<br />
My fellow workers come from all over the motherland<br />
They carry all kinds of companionship with them <br />
Using our callous fingers<br />
we play together, making music in the lonely wilderness<br /></p>

<p>These beautiful lines summarize the theme of solidarity in this poem. While migrant workers come from all over China, making their way into the city, they can carry a sense of companionship along their disconnected journeys. The last two lines of the poem are most evocative of this collective spirit, as migrant workers come together from all parts of the country, playing music in harmony with their callous hands.</p>

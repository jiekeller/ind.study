            It has already been close to 3 years since I left here<br />
            Today I suddenly remembered<br />
            only two tall ginkgo trees remain<br />
            People who return here <br />
            have already spent the remaining years of their lives elsewhere <br />
            There is traffic at the bus stop <br />
            But there isn’t a bus that can take me to my battlefield <br />
            The things we want to look for <br />
            are dispersed one by one by the autumn wind<br />
            Even the General’s headquarters and tracks <br />
            have only left doubts and loneliness<br />
            The bus leading to Dongzhimen<br />
            also leads to a torrential rain<br />
            The person facing the window<br />
            The glass reflects his gray hair and he realizes<br />
            No matter where the bus leads<br />
            he’s really going to his tomb <br />
            Poplar flowers are snowy, poplar leaves green<br />
            Women under the shade face passerbyers<br />
            selling a Shandong apple <br />
            The youth on the yellow cart rides with happiness on two wind wheels <br />
            Half the car section holds apples<br />
            the other half, a script of their lives, impossible to be written<br />

                In this poem, Chen Nianxi uses many historical military references to demonstrate the battle-like, life-and-death circumstances for migrant workers. As the poet waits for a bus to take him to his factory, he questions his life, job and social mobility. Chen Nian-Xi writes, <br />

                In the first stanza above, Chen Nian-Xi uses the analogy of a battlefield in comparison to the factory or manual work he will soon go to, defining the stakes of his workplace and his labor as a life-and-death battle. Chen Nian-Xi additionally references General Fu, a 20th century KMT general, employing this historical reference to show the loneliness and uncertainty of migrant worker life in the next line. In this second stanza, the lines depicting a man on the bus demonstrate Chen Nianxi’s belief that not only do migrant workers lose their youth in labor, but also their lives as they are really “going to [their] tomb” each time they get on a factory bus.

      <h1 id="chinese-workers">Chinese Workers</h1>
<p><strong>By Xiao Hai</strong></p>

<p>I am a Chinese worker<br />
Every corner of the world has our revolutionary companions<br />
maybe it’s intentional or maybe it’s unintentional<br />
But we all stand here, true and real<br />
Using our two laboring hands to face the storm engulfing the globe<br />
<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
In this large, steel, concrete building, they rear our cheap youth like cattle<br />
The changes of the seasons don’t belong to us<br />
the food and vegetables are not concerned with us <br />
All we can do is export the mysterious barcode Made in China, a flowing frenzy reaching <br />
every street and neighborhood of the four oceans and seven continents <br />
Using the spoils of war obtained in the October Revolution in exchange for tickets to home at the end of the year<br />
<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
The mundane points of the day in time’s gears make me boil and explode<br />
That shipping container crossing the sea carries all of our transient, futile pursuits<br />
Years of stars and sparks whizz by<br />
The heavy rain enters my chest, the strong wind blows endlessly <br /></p>

<p>In the lightning and thunder I ask myself<br />
when do we give ourselves the time to follow a wild pursuit of life<br />
8,000 li too far<br />
3,000 li too close<br />
We, in this vast land of 9,600,00 square kilometer <br />
surviving through the night<br />
I came from the village<br />
You came from the town<br />
We toil together, barefoot, in this dazzling, dreamlike, solid metropolis.<br />
<br />
Facing the gunshot of the second Industrial Revolution<br />
I want to write a letter to the blonde, blue-eyed yuppie on the opposite shore of the ocean<br />
A non-deliverable letter <br />
Tell them how gorgeous spring flowers are <br />
Tell them how high the birds fly in the sky<br />
Tell them the people walking on that ground<br />
Look so well-dressed<br />
Ah, they makes us feel ashamed of ourselves<br />
On the workshop’s hotbed we shamefully fall asleep in a flash <br />
Not knowing how, we woke up unexpectedly from this dream without a sign<br />
We don’t understand at all<br />
The unbearable pain<br />
I more so want to ask them<br />
Why do clouds cover the sun at dawn<br />
Why, after rain, does the sky not have a rainbow<br />
Why do the city night lights resemble the daytime<br />
Why the once vast and mighty river is now full of sparkling neon lights or a barren wasteland, covered in weeds<br />
It is overgrown with ramparts like the Great Wall’s Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers as far as the eye can see<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers holding bronze in their hands<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers smoking cigarettes<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers equipped with clanging armor plating<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers, silent as the dead <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
Overgrown with Chinese workers<br />
I am a Chinese worker<br />
<br /></p>

<p>In this long poem, Xiao Hai critiques the societal and global effects of China’s industrialization and expresses the anger and emotions of a Chinese worker. This poem firstly speaks to the hardships endured by workers like Xiao Hai. He writes that the material concerns of many modern citizens would be considered a luxury in the daily tasks of migrant workers and many of the hopes and dreams they hold are lost overtime. Xiao Hai then goes on to question and condemn the pollution and industrialization of his country and the world. He writes,<br /></p>

<p>We, in this vast land of 960,000 square kilometer <br />
Surviving through the night<br />
I came from the village<br />
You came from the town<br />
We toil together, barefoot, in this dazzling, dreamlike, solid metropolis.<br /></p>

<p>These lines exemplify the powerful solidarity between workers, a central theme of migrant worker poetry. Coming from many different rural areas, these migrant workers come together in the city, laboring under the ethereal bright lights and tall buildings. Xiao Hai speaks to the importance of this togetherness and collective spirit in this poem. He concludes by repeating the lines “Overgrown with Chinese Workers…” for eight lines, comparing contemporary industrial workers to ancient fighters of China’s past, promoting the rebellious spirit of the migrant working class. The last line, “I am a Chinese worker,” ties the poem together with Xiao Hai’s powerful utterance that he is taking ownership and agency of his status.</p>

      <p>This line literally translates to “Chinese workers as silent as a mystery.” However, this phrase does not have the same metaphorical weight in English, so I translated this as “Chinese workers, silent as the dead.” <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

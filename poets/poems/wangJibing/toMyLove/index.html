            Lying on the bunk bed<br />
            I wrote you a letter<br />
            These past few years<br />
            we’ve already become accustomed to<br />
            using ink to pass the extra time<br />
            Letting our souls walk quietly on the paper<br />
            A long time in poverty<br />
            has taught us to save<br />
            Saving our sweet time together<br />
            Saving our intimate company<br />
            Preserving our longing<br />
            Preparing for our future<br />
            Those powerless old years<br />

            In this romantic poem, the poet delves into the necessary sacrifices made by migrant workers, who give up time and intimacy with their loved ones in order to make a living. The first lines of the poem describes the acclimation of the subject and their loved one to a distanced relationship. Wang Jibing uses the evocative imagery of ink, soul and paper to express love through the words written on paper, as the couple sends letters back and forth. The second half of the poem focuses on these specific sacrifices made by the two lovers in order to survive.

            The last line in this poem is especially difficult to translate. While this word “无能为力” directly translates to “powerless,” this does not completely reflect the weak, wearisome lifestyle of old age. This kind of preservation of intimacy demonstrates the perseverance of migrant workers, and even the romantic lens they courageously give to their plight. In not seeing their loved one, the poet cherishes that intimacy, and hopes to savor it in older age.

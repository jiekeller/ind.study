# Red May
**By Xu Duo**

You finally appear as you should<br />
On this long, long walked road<br />
Not fearing now, unafraid of the future<br />
How did you get here? Where are you going?<br />

This world leads us to monotonous delusions and fantasies<br />
Working people can go nowhere freely<br />
Looking at myself, I am heavy with sorrow<br />
Looking at the world, my blood boils with rage<br />

History turns onward<br />
The feeling has returned again<br />
You are a May youth<br />
Free your imagination and walk the earth together<br />

I won’t allow myself to grow old<br />
There are too many things I have yet to do<br />
Have you prepared to travel a road wild and untamed<br />
or predictably go elsewhere<br />

That many wandering brothers and sisters drifting about<br />
That many desperate and struggling, ready to boil over<br />
That many people will come together in the end<br />
A blazing, fiery red May<br />
Just you and I, in our new performance<br />

---------------<br />

Akin to many of his other pieces, this poem by Xu Duo wields the powerful language of Red May to galvanize the collective spirit of Chinese migrant workers all over the country. The month of May holds strong revolutionary and laborer significance, as both the international Labor Day and the May Fourth Youth movement occurred in May. Xu Duo utilizes this revolutionary fervor combined with a day celebrating the dedicated work of laborers to inspire his fellow migrant workers. At the end of the poem, Xu Duo writes:

That many wandering brothers and sisters drifting about<br />
That many desperate and struggling, ready to boil over<br />
That many people will come together in the end<br />
A blazing, fiery red May<br />
Just you and I, in our new performance<br />

Xu Duo concludes the poem by inviting the readers, presumably migrant workers like him, to join in a “new performance.” As migrant workers have struggled in this society for so long, the fire and spirit they possess will be even more powerful as they come together and build a brighter future.

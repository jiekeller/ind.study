      <h1 id="they-say">They Say</h1>
<p><strong>By Xu Lizhi</strong></p>

<p>This mechanical plant is filled with the blood and sweat of many workers<br />
As they walk, I often hear their heavy talking<br />
They say, I haven’t gone home once in three years<br />
They say, my home is in Henan, Sichuan, Hainan, Guangxi<br />
They say, once I have enough money, my girlfriend and I will go home and have a baby<br />
They say, according to the year, my son should be nine years old this year<br />
……</p>

<p>I’m like an eavesdropper, hiding in the corner, listening to what they say<br />
Each word, bloody red, soaking away in the paper, inevitably fades away<br />
The pen and paper in my hand fall to the ground<br />
They say…<br /></p>

<p>—————<br /></p>

<p>As the title alludes to, this poem speaks to Xu’s disillusionment with the economic and social mobility of migrant workers like himself. The “they” here refers to migrant workers he may have worked with and Xu Lizhi recounts the tragic quotes he likely heard in passing during his time working in the factories. Xu highlights the trapped nature of these workers, some not returning to their hometowns once in over three years. Others seem unsure of their child’s age, questioning how old they should be according to the calendar year. Xu concludes the poem with his recurrent theme of blood and death. Xu writes</p>

<p>I’m like an eavesdropper, hiding in the corner, listening to what they say<br />
Each word, bloody red, soaking away in the paper, inevitably fades away <br />
The pen and paper in my hand fall to the ground<br /></p>

<p>Xu feels separated and isolated from the migrant workers he hears stories from, only able to write down their words in blood. As the bloody characters soaks into the paper and fade away, Xu Lizhi implies he fades away as well. The pen and paper falling out of his hand, clattering to the ground.</p>
